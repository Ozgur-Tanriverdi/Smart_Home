# Smart_Home
# When I'm home mode is active, our smart home switches on and off the lamps depending on the distance sensor and runs the cooling system with the help of the fan depending on the temperature sensor and adjusts the rotation speed of the fan according to the temperature. 
# When I am not at home mode is active, the alarm rings when someone enters the house with the help of the distance sensor. These modes can be controlled with the interface designed in Python. 
# In addition, with the help of multiple linear regression, a machine learning method used in Python, the speed of the fan can be adjusted depending on inputs such as the number of people and room size.

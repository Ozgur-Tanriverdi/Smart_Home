# Smart_Home
# When I'm home mode is active, our smart home switches the lamps (LEDs) on and off depending on the HC-SR04 distance sensor and operates the cooling system with the help of the fan (DC motor) depending on the DHT-11 temperature sensor and adjusts the rotation speed of the fan according to the temperature. 
# When I'm not at home mode is active, an alarm (buzzer) rings when someone enters the house with the help of a distance sensor. 
# With the help of HC-06 bluetooth module, these modes can be controlled with the interface designed in Python. 
# In addition, using the temperature data sent to the computer with the bluetooth module, the speed of the fan can be adjusted depending on inputs such as the number of people and room size with the help of multiple linear regression, a machine learning method used in Python.
